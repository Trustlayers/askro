# Step 3 Completion Summary: Refactor Assets Loading for Shortcode Presence

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

### Requirements Met:

1. **✅ Opened includes/core/class-askro-assets.php → enqueue_assets()**
   - Successfully accessed and modified the `enqueue_assets()` method

2. **✅ Implemented unified flag pattern per project Rule #1**
   - Changed from `$is_askro_page = false` to `$load_core_assets = false` as required
   - Added check for `has_shortcode($post->post_content, 'askro_questions_archive')` to set flag true
   - Follows strict two-step pattern from Rule #1

3. **✅ Inside final if ($load_core_assets) block enqueue main CSS/JS and localize once**
   - All asset enqueuing moved inside single `if ($load_core_assets)` block
   - Script localization done once with `wp_script_is('askro-main-script', 'localized')` check
   - No duplicated or multiple conditional blocks

4. **✅ Removed obsolete conditions tied to is_post_type_archive('question')**
   - Removed complex conditions and consolidated into unified logic
   - Eliminated redundant `$wp_query` checks and multiple conditional blocks
   - Kept only essential `is_singular('question')` check and shortcode checks

5. **✅ Unit-tested on pages with and without shortcode**
   - Created and ran comprehensive test covering:
     - Page WITH `[askro_questions_archive]` shortcode → Assets load ✅
     - Page WITHOUT any askro shortcodes → Assets don't load ✅
     - Page with different askro shortcode → Assets load ✅
   - All tests passed successfully

### Code Changes Made:

#### In `enqueue_assets()` method:
- **STEP 1: UNIFIED CONDITION CHECK**
  - Single `$load_core_assets = false` flag
  - Check `is_singular('question')` 
  - Check shortcodes: `askro_questions_archive`, `askro_submit_question_form`, `askro_user_profile`
  - Fallback URL check for `/questions/` paths

- **STEP 2: DECOUPLED ASSET LOADING**
  - Single `if ($load_core_assets)` block
  - Main script enqueuing
  - Specific asset loading based on nested conditions
  - Single localization with duplicate check

#### In `force_load_main_stylesheet()` method:
- Updated to use identical unified flag logic
- Maintains consistency between both methods
- Same shortcode checks including `askro_questions_archive`

### Compliance with Project Rules:

✅ **Rule #1**: Perfect adherence to unified flag pattern
✅ **Rule #2**: Single Responsibility Principle maintained in Askro_Assets class
✅ **Rule #3**: Security maintained with existing escaping functions
✅ **All other rules**: No violations introduced

### Testing Results:
```
=== Asset Loading Test for askro_questions_archive shortcode ===

Test 1: Page with [askro_questions_archive] shortcode
Status: ✅ PASS

Test 2: Page without any askro shortcodes  
Status: ✅ PASS

Test 3: Page with [askro_user_profile] shortcode
Status: ✅ PASS
```

## Summary
Step 3 has been completed successfully with full compliance to project Rule #1's unified flag pattern. The asset loading logic now properly detects the `askro_questions_archive` shortcode and loads core assets accordingly, while maintaining clean, maintainable code structure.
